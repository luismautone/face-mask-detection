# Face Mask Detection

The project is about the development of an algorithm that could help in controlling the use of masks in public places by the analysis of video footage.

## Face Detection

Detect person faces from images taken in a wild environment with [<b>MTCNN</b>](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn), a CNN that exploits multi-task learning to integrate face detection and face alignment.

In ```FaceMaskDetection_main.ipynb```, MTCNN was evaluated on [<i>Face Mask Dataset</i>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditya276/face-mask-dataset-yolo-format) that contains 924 images of people with and without mask.

| Precision | Recall |  F1  |
| --------- | ------ | ---- |
|   82.8%   | 74.4%  | 78.4%|

### Mask Prediction

Predict the presence of masks with [<b>MobileNetV2</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381), a network architecture that performs feature extraction for object detection and segmentation.

In ```MaskDetection_training.ipynb``` the cited network was trained on [<i>Face Mask Detection ~12K Images Dataset</i>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset) that contains only faces of people with and without masks.

In ```FaceMaskDetection_main.ipynb``` the trained MobileNetV2 model was used evaluated on the <i>Face Mask Dataset</i>.

|              | Precision | Recall | F1  |
| ------------ | --------- | ------ | --- |
| WithMask     | 75%       | 93%    | 83% |
| WithoutMask  | 91%       | 69%    | 78% |
